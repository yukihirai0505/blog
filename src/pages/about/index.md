### Self Introduction

Currently, I am working as a server-side engineer for four years.

I changed my career from sales staff in the human resources industry to a software engineer in 2014.

Because I thought "I want to create web services that people around the world are pleased with".

As a software engineer, I support everything from requirements definition to software implementation, testing, security check.

My strength is "breakthrough strength to push forward to the determined goal".

My friend says, "You seem like Barça." Barça is a very strong football club.

It is not related to programming, but I am very good at playing volleyball ;)
